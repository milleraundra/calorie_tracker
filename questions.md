#Questions

1. Is the 'bootstrap' listed in the main.ts file the front-end bootstrap framework we've been using?
2. ^If so, how would I go about using a different framework, like materialize?
3. How do I save inputs from parent or child components as properties of the current class? Parent -> input -> Child(I want to save that as a property).
4. eatenCalories and remainCalories function both do not use publicly defined variables. Is this acceptable? What is the work-around?
5. Edit form breaks calorie counter because calories are not taken as numbers, but as strings. Could not find solution.
